Today I learned about the [aggregation](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/aggregation/) operations that MongoDB can provide on your documents.

This may prove helpful on the EVA project as the calculations we'll need to perform require aggregation on the sensor data we're storing.

I also leanred that $unwind can be used to aggregate on arrays of objects within a group of documents you wish to perform aggregates on.
